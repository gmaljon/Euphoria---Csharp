# Euphoria---Csharp
Simple rhythm game with basic beat detection.

Written in C# via Visual Studio Community Edition 2015.

The software is still in its early stage (5-day old project) so expect a couple of bugs. The beat detection is not 100% accurate but its pretty doable. This program aims to teach students like me that coding isn't that hard if you are really into it. Feel free to submit bugs and issues in the "Issues" tab and if possible, provide a screenshot of it. I'm planning to develop a Unity version of this project if time allows me to do so. Thank you for reading!
