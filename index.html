      <p>Nothing to do this vacation? Want to do something productive? Well, why not study C# !! C# is universal and can be used to create apps and games on any platform. So unless you want to be a burden to your family by taking a course that you don't like, do something that will enhance your programming skills. You took BS Computer Science ffs so you should be coding stuff. Don't expect to get a job (in CS field) if you don't know how to loop from 1 to 10. Seriously. </p>

<p>Few Steps to Success  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Download Visual Studio Community 2015. Don't ask for an installer because you should probably know Google by now. Here is the link just in case: <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>  </p></li>
<li><p>Open the Visual Studio Solution File. (gaem.sln)  </p></li>
<li><p>Right-click Form1.cs on the Solution Explorer (usually on the right side unless you're hippy enough to place it at the top)  </p></li>
<li><p>Click View Code. Don't bother to open the design because it is blank and everything, except the form itself and the timer, is made at run-time.  </p></li>
<li><p>READ THE CODE and the comments. Be familiar with creating objects at run-time. Embrace Abstraction, Inheritance and Polymorphism in its simplest state.  </p></li>
<li><p>Test the program. Modify stuff if you think that will improve the project even a bit.  </p></li>
<li><p>You CAN submit a pull request at the GitHub repository of this project. (that is if you have an account)  </p></li>
<li><p>Congratulations! If you don't know what I'm talking about here. GOOGLE IT.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I'm doing this because I care. <em>sigh</em> I know most of you don't. </p>
