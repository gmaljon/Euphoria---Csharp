  "body": "Nothing to do this vacation? Want to do something productive? Well, why not study C# !! C# is universal and can be used to create apps and games on any platform. So unless you want to be a burden to your family by taking a course that you don't like, do something that will enhance your programming skills. You took BS Computer Science ffs so you should be coding stuff. Don't expect to get a job (in CS field) if you don't know how to loop from 1 to 10. Seriously. \r\n\r\n\r\nFew Steps to Success  \r\n\r\n1. Download Visual Studio Community 2015. Don't ask for an installer because you should probably know Google by now. Here is the link just in case: [Google](http://www.google.com)  \r\n\r\n2. Open the Visual Studio Solution File. (gaem.sln)  \r\n\r\n3. Right-click Form1.cs on the Solution Explorer (usually on the right side unless you're hippy enough to place it at the top)  \r\n\r\n4. Click View Code. Don't bother to open the design because it is blank and everything, except the form itself and the timer, is made at run-time.  \r\n\r\n5. READ THE CODE and the comments. Be familiar with creating objects at run-time. Embrace Abstraction, Inheritance and Polymorphism in its simplest state.  \r\n\r\n6. Test the program. Modify stuff if you think that will improve the project even a bit.  \r\n\r\n7. You CAN submit a pull request at the GitHub repository of this project. (that is if you have an account)  \r\n\r\n8. Congratulations! If you don't know what I'm talking about here. GOOGLE IT.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm doing this because I care. *sigh* I know most of you don't. ",
